Initial Project Proposal
WRSPM Model

World Assumptions: You will be able to use this application to sell a vehicle, or search to buy a vehicle uploaded by another seller. With our advanced search feature, you will be able to find exactly what vehicle you are looking for, and nothing else. If you want to buy a used Toyota Camry, you will see nothing but used Toyota Camrys. Once you find the car of your dreams, you can leave your contact information with the seller and the seller can reach out at their earliest convenience. As a buyer, no signup will be required to search through our application.

User Requirements: If the user is the one selling a vehicle, as much information as possible is always recommended to make sure the buyer has a full understanding of what they are paying for. The minimum things we will ask for is:
•	Year
•	Make
•	Model
•	Mileage
•	Color
•	Condition
•	Price
•	Accident Report
•	VIN number
•	Service Report
•	Description
•	Photos of the Vehicle
•	Contact Information
•	Any Additional Information
Optionally, the seller can provide proof of ownership with a title or a registration.
For the buyer, nothing would be required to browse or shop on this website. They can contact the seller directly to determine a form of payment and potential price changes.

System Specification and Interface: We need to implement a search feature that allows the buyer to filter through Make, Model, and Year and then a search feature if the results are not what the buyer is looking for. We would then have a list of results with a photo and the Make, Model, Year, Color, and Price before the buyer clicks on the listing. At the bottom of every listing, we can implement a feature where the buyer can leave contact information for the seller, and the seller can contact the buyer for more information regarding the transaction.

Program: The program will have a built-in filter and search features, allowing the buyer to filter for a car they are looking for, and then on each listing, the buyer can leave contact information for the seller to reach out and arrange a potential meetup date. Once the buyer searches for a car, they will be met with a list of cars within the filter range of various colors, conditions, and with varying miles.

Interface: It will be a standard car search interface, with a Make, Model, and Year drop down menus in which the buyer can sort, and in that order, the buyer can leave a field or two blank to find results which check every box in a given field. The seller can upload a vehicle they are looking to sell with everything listed in the user requirements, with high priority on Make, Model, and Year. Sellers will be required to have a login in order to see if a buyer is interested in the vehicle, and if a buyer is interested, they can send their contact information to the seller through a window on the bottom of every listing.
